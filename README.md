# py-home

This is a fork of [Cameron Gray's](https://github.com/camerongray1515/) [Home-Automation-Hub](https://github.com/home-automation-hub/home-automation-hub/), which (hopefully) i will be keeping up-to-date.

## Getting Started

> Requirements
- Docker installed, [docs are here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-

#### Basic install

Commands may differ between machines, im using Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS

First we need to download the files and go into the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/levidavis/py-home.git
cd py-home/
```
Now we need to use the 'Make' command to make our docker image, you dont have to run it as root but personally i needed to to allowed docker commands

```
sudo make
```
once the docker image is made we run the docker multi-container in what i like to call "Test Mode" it basically shows us a log of what is happening just in case there is any problems
```
sudo docker-compose up
```
if there is no problem running the docker then we can go and close it using Ctrl + C
```
Ctrl + C
```
now we need to get the docker containter running in the background using this command:
```
sudo dokcer-compose up -d
```

Done!

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

```
Give an example
```
